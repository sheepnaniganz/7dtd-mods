Fatigue and hunger lower your maximum stamina cap and are displayed in black. Rest on furniture or sleep on beds to restore your maximum stamina cap.\n\nYour health and stamina recovery rate is determined by your hydration level. Food and water bars are located below your Health Bar and the stats are found on the character page in the core and extended character stats tabs.
